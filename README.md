AI-Powered Customer Complaint Prioritization

ComplaintAI – AI-Powered Customer Complaint Prioritization
🌟 Imagine This...
You're the head of customer experience at a telecom company, and your support center is flooded with hundreds of customer complaints every day.

Some customers report minor issues—a slight network slowdown or a billing question.
Others are experiencing critical problems—dropped calls, poor data speeds, or service outages that could lead to customer churn.
Your network engineers also provide KPI data, showing where the network is struggling—but this information isn't linked to complaints.
How do you decide which complaints to address first? 🔥

What if you could intelligently rank complaints based on:
✅ Customer sentiment – Are they angry, neutral, or happy?
✅ Technical impact – Do the complaints align with poor network KPIs?
✅ Severity prediction – Can AI classify complaints into high, medium, or low priority?
🚀 Introducing ComplaintAI
🚀 ComplaintAI is an AI-driven complaint management system that helps telecom companies prioritize customer complaints intelligently.

✅ Uses NLP (BERT) & Machine Learning (XGBoost) to analyze complaints.
✅ Predicts severity based on sentiment + network KPIs.
✅ Automatically ranks complaints so urgent issues are handled first.
✅ Deployable as an API to integrate with support ticketing systems.

🎯 How It Works
1️⃣ Collect Data 🗂️
📥 Loads customer complaints & network KPIs from CSV or database.

2️⃣ Analyze Sentiment 🤖
🧠 Uses BERT NLP model to determine customer sentiment (Positive/Negative).

3️⃣ Engineer Features 🏗️
🔍 Extracts insights using TF-IDF (text embeddings), complaint length, and network KPIs.

4️⃣ Train AI Model 🏆
📊 Uses XGBoost to predict complaint severity (High, Medium, Low).

5️⃣ Prioritize Issues 🔥
📌 Ranks complaints based on severity, sentiment, and technical impact.

6️⃣ Deploy as an API 🌍
🔗 The system can be integrated into customer service platforms (via FastAPI).

🛠️ Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ComplaintAI.git
cd ComplaintAI
2️⃣ Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the main workflow:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
4️⃣ Start the API (for integration with other services):

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn api:app --reload
🧪 Example Usage
Sample Input (Customer Complaints)
complaint_id area_id complaint_text
101 A1 "The network keeps dropping, so frustrating!"
102 A2 "The speed is a bit slow, but manageable."
103 A3 "My calls keep dropping, I might switch providers."
Sample Input (Network KPI Data)
area_id access_issue drop_call_rate voice_quality_score data_throughput
A1 1 5.2% 2.1 1.5 Mbps
A2 0 1.1% 4.5 15 Mbps
A3 1 6.7% 1.8 0.8 Mbps
Predicted Output (Prioritized Complaints)
complaint_id complaint_text sentiment severity priority_score
103 "My calls keep dropping..." Negative High 🚨 Urgent
101 "Network keeps dropping..." Negative Medium ⏳ Needs Attention
102 "Speed is a bit slow..." Positive Low ✅ Can Wait
💡 Now your customer service team knows exactly which issues to resolve first!

🖥️ API Usage (For Integration)
Start the API with:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn api:app --reload
Then send a POST request with complaint data:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"complaint_id": 104,
"area_id": "A1",
"complaint_text": "My internet is not working, terrible service!"
}
The API returns a predicted severity score and priority ranking.

📊 Why This Matters
🚀 Faster issue resolution → Customers get help before churning.
🎯 Data-driven prioritization → AI helps support teams focus on urgent cases.
⚡ Smarter decision-making → Network teams can fix technical issues based on complaints.
📡 Scalable & deployable → Can integrate with customer service chatbots or CRM tools.
🔧 Future Enhancements
✅ Deploy as a cloud-based microservice.
✅ Use LLMs (GPT, T5) for even better complaint understanding.
✅ Train a deep learning model (LSTM or Transformer-based).
✅ Extend to voice-based complaints (Speech-to-Text + NLP Analysis).
